About


</header>

This project is the implementation phase of the SDLC and is based on my coursework completed in IT-315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design. The course used OOAD methodologies and UML to develop an IS for enabling student registration in college courses. The approach was use-case driven, architecture-centric, and iterative & incremental. My work in developing the functional, structural, and behavioral models, along with verification and validation to the original system requirements earned a perfect score.


The goal of this portfolio is to highlight my past and present work. Currently, I am developing the application with Spring to integrate the database and user authentication. Future versions will include implementing a GUI. The current state exists as a command line program, written in Java and linked to an SQL database using the JDBC API.
