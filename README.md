Student Information System

This software development project continues with the Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design method of information systems development and is based on my coursework completed in IT-315 Object Oriented Analysis and Design. The approach was use-case driven, architecture-centric, and iterative & incremental. My work in developing the functional, structural, and behavioral models, along with verification and validation to the original system requirements earned a perfect score.


The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my past and present work, and glimpse future endeavors, such as implementing a graphical user interface, achieving best practices in user verification and validation, and utilizing various other database management systems. The current state exists as a command line program, written in Java and linked to an SQL database using the JDBC API.
